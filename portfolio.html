            <h3>INVESTIGATION OF CI ENGINE PERFORMANCE
CHARACTERISTICS BY THE ACCUMULATION OF
COBALT OXIDE (CO304) NONO-PARTICLES WITH RED
RADISH BIOFUEL</h3>
            <img src="project-image.jpg" alt="Project Title">
            <p>The ever-growing demand for fuel sources, the rising prices of gasoline and diesel, and the harmful exhaust gases in the atmosphere are a few of the many reasons why biofuels need to be utilized. The use of Red radish biofuel as biodiesel in CI engines shows promising results under numerous conditions, with properties such as high volatility and low viscosity and it innately emits lesser emissions during combustion. The research involves a structured approach to investigating the capability of a 20% volumetric blend of Red radish biofuel mixed in diesel and is compared with a diesel under commensurable conditions. From this experimentation, it has been found that the heating value of Red radish biofuel leads to lower BTE and higher fuel consumption rate even after the optimization. So that, to enhance the performance characteristics of the engine, the Cobalt oxide (CO3O4) nanoparticles are mixed with the Red radish biofuel at 50 and 100 ppm concentrations.</p>
